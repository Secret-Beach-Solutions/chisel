This projects seeks next level blockchain adoption for consensus and visibility. It enables individuals to
collaborate in order to prompt GPT systems more efficiently. Because each user interacts with GPT in a sort 
of "sealed garden", they are not able to see each others.

While most users seem to treat a GPT as a "digital butler", a very small group interact with it in very
different ways. This group might be referred to as "Protocol Hackers". This tool offers them a toolkit for 
prompting GPT in a novel way.

Chisel includes a small script which is able to create readable digibyte thunderwords. These are special addresses
that can easily be read. This version of Chisel if made to operate on the digibyte ledger. An example of a 
"chisel" message is:
<pre><code>[
  [ 
    { "txid": "a3349258e17e807b7e0074bc17d89cb675be7656e4a0f5946515a872549c0f63", "vout": 0 }
  ],
  [ 
    { "DBxCHiSELzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZj3nAB": 0.00006 },
    { "DCxWESTWoRLDzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzXeBskz": 0.00006 },
    { "data": "00" }
